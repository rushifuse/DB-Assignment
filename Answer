1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the  diagram.
Ans :- 
      In a typical relational database schema, the relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" 
      entities would likely be a one-to-many relationship. This means that each product belongs to one category,
      but each category can have multiple products associated with it. This relationship is usually implemented 
      through a foreign key constraint in the "Product" table, where the primary key of the "Product_Category" table is referenced.


2.  How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Ans :- 
      To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity using 
      foreign key constraints. This means that the foreign key column in the "Product" table, which references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table, 
      will only accept values that exist in the primary key column of the "Product_Category" table. In other words, every value in the foreign key column
      (representing the category of a product) must correspond to an existing category in the "Product_Category" table.
